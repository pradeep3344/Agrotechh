To provide a medium of communication between farmers and buyers(customer).To increase the crop yields, crop sales and crop profits for the farmers .To reduce the cost of crops so that the people can buy them easily at a reduced price.  

Direct marketing of agricultural produce helps in complete elimination of middle men and commission agents who charge high level of commission fee from the agriculturists/farmers coming to the market yards for selling their produce and then artificially inflate the retail prices.

The benefits realized by cutting out the middleman and getting direct feedback from the customer can make these marketing avenues worth the labor required to sell directly.


1) INTRODUCTION:- 

How it works….


            Farmers buddy involves selling a product from the farm directly to           customers.
           Often, the farmer receives a price similar to what the grocery store charges.
           This method of marketing is more entrepreneurial or business-like than wholesale marketing.
           In a manner of speaking, the farmer using this method grows a “product” more than a crop.
           The opportunity to interact with growers is one of the reasons consumers like to purchase this way.
The experience of the purchase is often part of the product.




Modules:-

1)	User Module:

 First, to enter this system the users has to login to this system. Basically there are 3 types of users in this system. 
•	Farmers and customer – Has restricted access

2)	Market Details:

 In this module we can maintain the market details. This module will be enabled only to the admin type of users.
This module contains:
•	A separate screen should be provided to maintain the market related information. It should provide a way to add, modify and delete the market related information.
•	Administrator type of user can add the commodities in the market.
•	He can add the information about new markets into the system.
•	He can add the market report into the system regarding a particular market and commodities prices details in that market in a data


2)LITERATURE SURVEY:-

i)	The application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in agriculture is increasingly important. E-Agriculture involves the conceptualization, design, development, evaluation and application of innovative ways to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can play a significant role in maintaining properties of information as it consists of three main technologies. These technologies are applied for processing, exchanging and managing data, information and knowledge.


ii)	This paper proposes an Agro-Information System that enables a farmer to have relevant information about a crop, such as the varieties and other requirements like soil type, temperature, type and quantity of fertilizer, time of planting, time of maturity, planting distance, diseases, pest, pest and Disease control measures, rainfall, sunshine, etc. of that crop. The level of application of this information determines the volume and efficiency of the crop yield. AIS software is designed and implemented which helps the farmer achieve the afore-mentioned objectives.






3)	Planning & Requirements Specification:-

3.1) METHODOLOGY

3.1.1) Account Generation:
 It includes the creation of account, in which basic information of user, type of user, whether he is farmer, agent or Gov. Officer is submitted. Through this module, user gets the Unique ID which serves as the identity of user. 
3.1.2) Marketing:
 It includes Pricing, Billing and the Fund Transfer. Pricing will show the farmer at what price his commodity has been sold. Billing will create the bill after getting request from farmer for bill creation. Created bill will be displayed on the page. Bill will consist of unit price rate, total bill amount, commission of agent, vehicle fare, other expenditure, etc. Farmer can download or print the bill for future reference. Using fund transfer, Agent can transfer the invoice amount to farmers account and farmer can check whether amount has been transferred or not. One should be log in for using this facility. 
 3.1.3) Market Information:
 Farmer can see the market information of nearby market. This will consist of selling rates of different product, today’s turnover, product-wise details like quantity, grading, selling cost, etc. It will give commodity-wise, market-wise daily report, commodity wise price during last week, community transaction below MSP(maximum sale price), date wise prices for specified community. Farmer can also search for specific product in particular duration of specific market.


3.2) System Requirements
3.2.1) Technologies Used:
•	UML
•	Java script
•	J2EE
•	Servlets
•	JSP
•	HTML


7) CONCLUSION:-
This project will be helpful for farmers to know more about market information; will act as unique interface of schemes and compensation. Through this they will be always in touch of new technique and trends of farming. But some extends, new user may feel some kind of stress about its use. Overall this system is faster, secure and comfortable.
7.1)FUTURE WORK:-
  Here sales to restaurants, retail stores and institutions are included among farm direct marketing approaches because the farmer has some control over the price and the transaction is based on a relationship with a business owner.
Pricing varies and may be higher for sales to restaurants, but lower for grocery stores .
